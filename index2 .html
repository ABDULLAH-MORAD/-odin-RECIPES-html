    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup milk (or a milk alternative)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar (if using) until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the milk, egg, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract (if using) until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps are fine.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease it with cooking spray or butter.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup of the batter onto the hot griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and keep warm while you repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
